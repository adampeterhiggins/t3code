# Mobile notifications

Sign in to T3 Connect, link your environments, and enable **Device Notifications** in **Settings → Notifications** to receive alerts when an agent finishes, fails, needs approval, or asks for input. Tap a notification to open its thread. Your environment must have agent activity publishing enabled.

Enable **Ongoing Agent Activity** on Android or **Live Activity Updates** on iOS to follow work without opening the app. Finished results remain visible for up to 15 minutes. You can dismiss an Android activity card without disabling alerts; turn off ongoing activity in Settings to stop future cards.

## Choose what notifies you

Under **Settings → Notifications → Notify me about**, turn off the events you don't want pushed to this phone: approvals, questions, failed turns (including usage limits), or finished turns. Every event is on until you turn it off, and the choice applies to this device only. Pull request watch news reaches your phone as the turn it starts, so it follows **Turn finished**. Per-project muting is not available on mobile yet.

Notifications open the thread; they do not offer approve or reply buttons. Answer from the thread.

## Delivery

Ordinary alerts stay quiet while the mobile app is in the foreground. Ongoing activity continues to update. Viewing a thread on another device does not silence your phone's alerts.

Android notifications require Android 7.0 or newer and Google Play services. Android 16 and newer can promote ongoing activity to a Live Update, subject to system settings and device support. Other devices show a regular ongoing notification. Android 7's battery-saving modes can delay removal of expired cards.

Notification permission and Android notification channels are controlled in system Settings. Background delivery requires T3 Connect; a direct or Tailscale connection alone does not enable push notifications. The mobile app does not need to maintain a connection to your environment. Force-stopping the Android app in system Settings prevents push delivery until you open it again.
